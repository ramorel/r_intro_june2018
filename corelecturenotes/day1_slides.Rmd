# Introduction

## Why R?

## RStudio and RStudio Server

## Some key concepts

## Recall your DataCamp course

By now, you should all have completed the *Introduction to R* course on DataCamp. Congratulations! You already know quite a lot about how R works. 

To refresh, you covered the following material in your course:

- Arithmetic with R
- Objects and variable assignment
- Data types, including: character, numeric, logical, factors
- Data structures, including: vectors, matricies, data frames, lists

<aside class="notes">
Today, we will briefly review the above topics, and then turn to new material on reading and writing files, data manipulation, and data visualization.
</aside>

# Review: Basics and data types 

## Arithmetic

Open up the file `day1_exercises.R` in RStudio. Do the following tasks:

- Pick a number; save it as `x`
- Multiply x by 3
- Take the log of the above <small>(Hint, you need the function `log()` here)</small>
- Subtract 4 from the above
- Square the above

## Arithmetic

```{r arithmetic}
x <- 5
x*3
log(x*3)
log(x*3)-4
(log(x*3)-4)^2
```

## Comparisons and Logical Operators

- Check if 1 is bigger than 2
- Check if 1 + 1 is equal to 2
- Check if it is true that the strings "eat" and "drink" are not equal to each other
- Check if it is true that 1 is equal to 1 *AND* 1 is equal to 2 
  <small>(Hint: remember what the operators `&` and `|` do)</small>
- Check if it is true that 1 is equal to 1 *OR* 1 is equal to 2

## Comparisons and Logical Operators

```{r comparisons}
1 > 2
(1 + 1) == 2
"eat" != 'drink'
(1==1) & (1==2)
(1==1) | (1==2)
```

## Packages

- Install the package `tidyverse`
- Load the package `tidyverse`
- Open the help file for the function `recode` 
  <small>(Hint: remember what `?` does)</small>

## Packages

```{r packages, eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)

?recode
```

## Data types

- **logical**: `TRUE` or `FALSE` 
  <small>(When co-coerced into numeric type, `TRUE`=`1` and `FALSE`=`0`)</small>
- **integer**: a specific type; most numbers are numeric instead
- **numeric**: real or decimal 
- **complex**: ex: `2+5i`
- **character**: `"text data"`, denoted with quotes
  <small>(`'single quotes'` and `"double quotes"` both work)</small>
- Use `typeof()` on an object to check its type

# Review: Data structures

## Vectors

- Vectors store multiple values of a single data type
- Create a vector using the `c()` function
- Vectors are homogenous: each vector can only contain one data type
- Arithmetic operators and many functions can apply to vectors
- Vectors can be *indexed* by element position (`vec[1]`), by 'slice' position (`vec[1:3]`), or by condition (`vec[vec>2]`).

## Vectors

Return to the exercise file and complete the following tasks:

- Run the code to generate variables `x1` and `x2`
- Select the 3rd element in `x1`
- Select the elements of x1 that are less than 0
- Select the elements of x2 that are greater than 1
- Create x3 containing the first five elements of x2
- Select all but the third element of x1

## Vectors

```{r vectors}
set.seed(1234) 
x1 <- rnorm(5)
x2 <- rnorm(20, mean=0.5)
x1[3]
x1[x1 < 0]
x2[x2 > 1]
x3 <- x2[1:5]
x1[-3]
```

## Interlude: Missing Values

Variables in datasets sometimes include missing variables. In R, missing values are stored as `NA`. Vectors containing any data type can contain missing values. Functions deal with missing values differently, and sometimes require arguments to specify how to deal with missing values.

```{r missing values}
vec <- c(1, 8, NA, 7, 3)
mean(vec)
mean(vec, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Factors

- Factors are a special type of vector that are useful for categorical variables
- Factors have a limited number of *levels* that the variable can take, set by the user
- For categorical variables with natural ordering between categories, we often want to use *ordered factors*
- Create factors with `factor()`, which includes an argument for `levels = `

<aside class="notes">
We won't spend any more time reivewing factors today. If you need a refresher, check the lecture notes or review data camp. Each one tells you about factors from a different angle. The lecture notes focus on the utility of ordered factors, whereas data camp spends additional time on unordered factors.
</aside>

## Lists

- Lists are like vectors, but more complex.
- Lists are *heterogenous*: they can store single elements, vectors, or even lists.
- You can keep multi-dimensional and ragged data in R using lists.
- You can index an element in a list using double brackets: `[[1]]`. Single brackets will return the element as a list.

<aside class="notes">
For more on lists, see the lecture notes or data camp.
</aside>

## Matricies

- Matrices in R are two-dimensional arrays. 
- Matrices are *homogenous*: all values of a matrix must be of the same data type. 
- You can initialize a matrix using the `matrix()` function.
- Matrices are used sparingly in R, primarly for numerical calculations or explicit matrix manipulation.
- Matrices are indexed as follows: `mat[row no, col no]`.

<aside class="notes">
If you leave the row number blank in the index, R will return the entire column. If you leave the column number blank, it will return the entire row. We will see how this works with data frames in a moment.
There is an example matrix for you to practice with in the exercises file, but we won't do it together.
</aside>

## Data frames

- Data frames are the core data structure in R. A data frame is a list of named vectors with the same length.
- Data frames are *heterogenous*: the vectors in a data frames can each be of a different data type.
- Columns are typically variables and rows are observations.
- You can make make data frames by using the `data.frame()` function, or by combining vectors with `cbind()` or `rbind()`.
- Data frames can be indexed in the same way as matricies: `df[row no, col no]`.
- Data frames can also be indexed by using variable/column names: `df["var"]` or `df$var`.

## Data frames

- Load the example data frame using the code provided
- Identify the number of observations (rows) and number of variables (columns)
- Identify the names of the variables
- Select the variable `mpg`
- Select the 4th row
- Square the value of the `cyl` variable and store this as a new variable `cylsq`

# Break!

Let's take a break and return to learn two new skills: **reading files** and basic **data manipulation**.

# Reading files

## Working directories -- ASK LEWIS ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS IN RSTUDIO SERVER

## Reading files: read.csv()

```{r read.csv intro, eval=F}
gapminder5 <- read.csv("data/gapminder5.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

```{r read.csv breakdown, eval=F}
gapminder5 <- read.csv(file = "data/gapminder5.csv",
                       sep = ",",
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Reading files: read_csv()

- Install the `readr` package
- Use `read_csv()` to load the gapminder data

## Reading files: read_csv()-- FIX THIS LATER

```{r read_csv pt1, eval=F}
install.packages("reader")
```

```{r read_csv pt2}
library(readr)
gapminder5 <- read_csv("C:/Users/kumar/OneDrive - Northwestern University - Student Advantage/Assistantships & Jobs/MSiA/r_intro_june2018/data/gapminder5.csv")
```

## Reading files

- You can also read files from URLs or the full local path
- You can import files using RStudio's interface through the "Files" tab
- For other file types, use the packages `haven` (Stata, SAS, SPSS) or `readxl` (Excel)

# Data manipulation

## Exploring data frames

- Remember: you can view data frames in RStudio with `View()` and examine other characteristics with `str()`, `dim()`, `names()`, `nrow()`, and more.
- When run on a data frame, `summary()` returns summary statistics for all variables.
- `mean()`, `median()`, `var()`, `sd()`, and `quantile()` operate as expected.
- Frequency tables are a simple and useful way to explore discrete/categorical variables in data frames
    - `table()` creates a frequency table of one or more variables
    - `prop.table()` can turn a frequency table into a proportion table

<aspect class="notes">
Notice that any data frames which have been read in or created, like all other objects, can be seen in the environment
</aspect>

## Exploring data frames

- Run `summary()` on the gapminder data
- Find the mean of the variable `pop`
- Create a frequency table of the variable `year`
  <small>(Hint: use `table()`)</small>
- Create a proportion table of the variable `continent`
  <small>(Hint: use `prop.table()`)</small>

## Exploring data frames

```{r exploring data frames pt1}
summary(gapminder5)
```

```{r exploring data frames pt2}
mean(gapminder5$pop)
table(gapminder5$continent)
prop.table(table(gapminder5$continent))
```

## Subsetting

- One of the benefits of R is that we can work with multiple data frames at the same time
- We will often want to *subset* a data frame, i.e. work with a portion of the data frame
- There are several ways to subset a data frame
    - You can write conditional statement in index brackets: `gapminder5[gapminder5$continent=="Asia",]`
    - You can use the `subset()` function: `subset(gapminder5, subset=continent=="Asia")`

<aspect class="notes">
The most obvious use case of subsetting is to create a separate, smaller data frame, which we will do shortly. But think also about how useful it is to quickly subset a data frame by condition: we can use subsets as inputs for statistical models, for example.
</aspect>

## Sorting

- 

## Subsetting and Sorting

- Create a new data frame called `gapminder07` containing only those rows in the gapminder data where `year` is 2007
- Created a sorted frequency table of the variable `continent` in `gapminder07`
  <small>(Hint: use `table()` and `sort()`)</small>
- Print out the population of Mexico in 2007
- Try the bonus question if you have time

## Subsetting and Sorting

```{r subsetting and sorting}
gapminder07 <- subset(gapminder5, subset = year==2007)
sort(table(gapminder07$continent))
gapminder07$pop[gapminder07$country=="Mexico"]
head(gapminder07[order(gapminder07$pop),])
```

<aspect class="notes">
Don't worry too much about the bonus question if you find it confusing. The package `dplyr`, which we will cover on Thursday, will offer other ways to do this kind of task which some of you may find more intuitive.
</aspect>

## Adding and removing columns

When cleaning or wrangling datasets in RStudio, we will often want to create new variables. There are several ways to add a vector as a new variable in R:

```{r adding columns, eval=F}
gapminder5 <- cbind(gapminder5, newvar)

gapminder5$newvar <- newvar
```

Removing columns is easy too:

```{r removing columns, eval=F}
gapminder$newvar <- NULL

gapminder <- gapminder[-"newvar"]
```

## Recoding variables

- A common task when cleaning/wrangling data is recoding variables.
- Think about what the recoded variable should look like & then decide on an approach.
    - Sometimes, a single function can accomplish the recoding task needed. Then, the new vector can be assigned to a new column in the data frame.
    - If no single function comes to mind, we can initialize a new variable in the data frame, and assign values to it using indexes and conditional statements.
    - More complex recoding tasks can be accomplished with other packages like `dplyr`, which we will return to on Day 3 and which you can preview in the lecture notes.
    
## Recoding variables

Work with the data frame `gapminder07` throughout this exercise.

- Round the values of the variable `lifeExp` using `round()` and store this as a new variable `lifeExp_round`
- Print out the new variable to see what it looks like
- Read through the code that creates the new variable `lifeExp_over70` and try to understand what it does.
- Try to create a new variable `lifeExp_highlow` that has the value "High" when life expectancy is over the mean and the value "Low" when it is below the mean.

## Recoding variables

```{r recoding variables}
gapminder07$lifeExp_round <- round(gapminder07$lifeExp)
head(gapminder07$lifeExp_round)
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow <- NA
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow[gapminder07$lifeExp>mean(gapminder07$lifeExp)] <- "High"
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow[gapminder07$lifeExp<mean(gapminder07$lifeExp)] <- "Low"
table(gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow)
```

## Aggregating

- Notice that the observations (i.e. rows) in our data frame are grouped; specifically, each country is grouped into a continent.
- We are often interested in summary statistics by groups.
- The `aggregate()` function accomplishes this: `aggregate(y ~ x, FUN = mean)` gives the mean of vector `y` for each unique group in `x`. 
    - `mean` can be replaced by other functions here, such as `median`.
- **Try it**! In the exercise file, find the mean of life expectancy in 2007 for each continent.

## Aggregating

```{r aggregating pt 1}
aggregate(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$continent, FUN = mean)
```

```{r aggregating pt 2}
aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder07, FUN = mean)
```

## Statistics

- Here are some easy statistical analyses to conduct in R
    - Correlations: `cor()`; Covariance: `cov()`
    - T-tests: `t.test(var1 ~ var2)`, where `var2` is the grouping variable
    - Linear regression: `lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)`
- You can store the results of these functions in objects, which is especially useful for statistical models with many components.

## Statistics

Use `gapminder07` for all the below exercises. You're using some new functions, so refer to help files whenever you get stuck.

- Calculate the correlation between `lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`.
- Use a t-test to evaluate the difference between `gdpPercap` in "high" and "low" life expectancy countries. Store the results as `t1`, and then print out `t1`.

## Statistics

```{r statistics pt 1}
cor(gapminder07$lifeExp, gapminder07$gdpPercap)
t1 <- t.test(gapminder07$gdpPercap~gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow)
t1 <- t.test(gdpPercap~lifeExp_highlow, data=gapminder07)
t1
```

- Note that `t1` shows up in the environment as a list. You can now call up the components of the t-test when you need them.

## Statistics

- Conduct a linear regression using `lm()` which predicts `lifeExp` as a function of `gdpPercap` and `pop`. Store the results as `reg1`.
    - You can define all the variables using the `df$var` syntax, or you can just use variable names and identify the data frame in the `data = ` argument.
    - Examples are shown at the bottom of the help file for `lm()`
- Print out `reg1`.
- Run `summary()` on `reg1`.

## Statistics

```{r statistics pt 2}
reg1 <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + pop, data = gapminder07)
reg1
summary(reg1)
```

# Writing files

## Writing a data file

- Earlier, we created a new data frame, `gapminder07`, and added several new variables to it.
- When we do more intensive data cleaning and wrangling tasks in R, we will often want to save the resulting data frame as a data file, so that it can be shared and used elsewhere easily.
- You can use `write.csv()` in base R and `write_csv()` in the `readr` package to write data files.
- **Try it!** Save the data frame `gapminder07` to your working directory using the `write.csv` function. Set the argument `row.names = FALSE`.

## Writing a data file

```{r writing files, eval=F}
write.csv(gapminder07, file = "data/gapminder07.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Save R objects

- You can save all the objects in your workspace using the `save.image()` function or by clicking the save icon in the Environment tab in the top-right pane. You can load all objects back in using `load.image()` or opening the `.RData` file that is created.
- You can save specific objects in an `.RData` file with the `save()` function.
- If your script file is well-written, you should be able to retrieve all your objects just by running your code again.
- If you have a project with code that takes a long time to run, I would recommend creating an R project, which will set your working directory and save/load your workspace every time you open an `.Rproj` file.

# Data visualization

## Base R vs. ggplot2

- We will only cover visualization briefly today, using some functions included in base R. Data scientists generally use other packages for data visualization, especially `ggplot2`, which we will cover on Day 3.
- So why learn data visualization in base R?
    - Some of the simple functions are useful ways to explore data while doing analysis.
    - The syntax of visualization in base R is often adopted by other packages.

## Histograms

- Histograms are a useful way to examine the distribution of a single variable. The base R function for histograms is simple: `hist()`.
- **Try it!** Create a histogram of the variable `lifeExp` in `gapminder07`. 
    - When you're done, look at the help file and try to re-create the histogram, this time with a title and axis labels.
    - Bonus: Change the `breaks = ` argument from its default setting and see what happens.
    
## Histograms

```{r histograms}
hist(gapminder07$lifeExp, main="Distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2007", xlab="Life expectancy", ylab="Frequency")
```

## Scatterplots

- You can create a scatterplot by providing a formula containing two variables (i.e. `y ~ x`) to the `plot()` function in R. 
- Titles and axis labels can be added in `plot()` similarly to `hist()`.
- The function `abline()` can "layer" straight lines on top of a `plot()` output.

## Scatterplots

- Create a scatterplot with `lifeExp` on the y-axis and `gdpPercap` on the x-axis.
- Add a title and axis labels.
- Bonus: Add a horizontal line indicating the mean of `lifeExp` onto the plot using `abline()`.

## Scatterplots

```{r scatterplot}
plot(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$gdpPercap,
     main="Relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007", ylab="Life expectancy", xlab="GDP per capita")
abline(h = mean(gapminder07$lifeExp))
```
